The astounding success even led to claims that the protein folding problem is ‚Äúsolved‚Äù. However, protein folding problem is more than just structure prediction from sequence. Presently, it is unknown if the AlphaFold-triggered revolution could help to solve other problems related to protein folding. Here we assay the ability of AlphaFold to predict the impact of single mutations on protein stability (ŒîŒîG) and function. To study the question we extracted metrics from AlphaFold predictions before and after single mutation in a protein and correlated the predicted change with the experimentally known ŒîŒîG values. Additionally, we correlated the AlphaFold predictions on the impact of a single mutation on structure with a large scale dataset of single mutations in GFP with the experimentally assayed levels of fluorescence. We found a very weak or no correlation between AlphaFold output metrics and change of protein stability or fluorescence. Our results imply that AlphaFold cannot be immediately applied to other problems or applications in protein folding.',

              'Prediction of proteins stability change (ŒîŒîG) due to single mutation is important for biotechnology, medicine, and our understanding of physics underlying protein folding. Despite the recent tremendous success in 3D protein structure prediction, the apparently simpler problem of predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability has been hampered by the low amount of experimental data. With the recent high-throughput measurements of mutational effects in ‚Äòmega‚Äô experiment for ~850,000 mutations [Tsuboyama et al., bioRxiv, 2022] it becomes possible to apply the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Here we explore the ability of ESM2 deep neural network architecture with added Light Attention mechanism to predict the change of protein stability due to single mutations. The resulting method ABYSSAL predicts well the data from the ‚Äòmega‚Äô experiment (Pearson correlation 0.85) while the prediction of ŒîŒîG values from previous experiments is more modest (Pearson correlation 0.50). ABYSSAL also shows a perfect satisfaction of the antisymmetry property. The ABYSSAL training demonstrated that the dataset should contain around ~100,000 data points for taking advantage of the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Overall, our study shows great perspectives for developing the deep learning ŒîŒîG predictors..',

              'The ability of protein chains to spontaneously form their three-dimensional structures is a long-standing mystery in molecular biology. The most conceptual aspect of this mystery is how the protein chain can find its native, ‚Äúworking‚Äù spatial structure (which, for not too big protein chains, corresponds to the global free energy minimum) in a biologically reasonable time, without exhaustive enumeration of all possible conformations, which would take billions of years. This is the so-called ‚ÄúLevinthal‚Äôs paradox.‚Äù In this review, we discuss the key ideas and discoveries leading to the current understanding of protein folding kinetics, including folding landscapes and funnels, free energy barriers at the folding/unfolding pathways, and the solution of Levinthal‚Äôs paradox. A special role here is played by the ‚Äúall-or-none‚Äù phase transition occurring at protein folding and unfolding and by the point of thermodynamic (and kinetic) equilibrium between the ‚Äúnative‚Äù and the ‚Äúunfolded‚Äù phases of the protein chain (where the theory obtains the simplest form). The modern theory provides an understanding of key features of protein folding and, in good agreement with experiments, it (i) outlines the chain length-dependent range of protein folding times, (ii) predicts the observed maximal size of ‚Äúfoldable‚Äù proteins and domains. Besides, it predicts the maximal size of proteins and domains that fold under solely thermodynamic (rather than kinetic) control. Complementarily, a theoretical analysis of the number of possible protein folding patterns, performed at the level of formation and assembly of secondary structures, correctly outlines the upper limit of protein folding times.',

              'Prediction of protein stability change upon mutation (ŒîŒîG) is crucial for facilitating protein engineering and understanding of protein folding principles. Robust prediction of protein folding free energy change requires the knowledge of protein three-dimensional (3D) structure. In case, protein 3D structure is not available, one can predict the structure from protein sequence; however, the perspectives of ŒîŒîG predictions for predicted protein structures are unknown. The accuracy of using 3D structures of the best templates for the ŒîŒîG prediction is also unclear.\rTo investigate these questions, we used a representative set of seven diverse and accurate publicly available tools (FoldX, Eris, Rosetta, DDGun, ACDC-NN, ThermoNet and DynaMut) for stability change prediction combined with AlphaFold or I-Tasser for protein 3D structure prediction. We found that best templates perform consistently better than (or similar to) homology models for all ŒîŒîG predictors. Our findings imply using the best template structure for the prediction of protein stability change upon mutation if the protein 3D structure is not available.',

              'The intricate genotype-phenotype relationship has been a long-standing issue in biology, important both from the fundamental and applied points of view. One of the major irregularities hindering progress in establishing these links is epistasis ‚Äì the complex and elusive interaction between mutations. Despite the vast accumulated genetic data and progress in this area, epistasis is still far from being completely understood. Epistasis can be studied quantitatively in combinatorially complete datasets, which form hypercubes in protein sequence space, where connected sequences are one mutation away from each other. However, this might be insufficient to portray the full picture of epistatic interactions. To extend the repertoire of the methods for exploring epistasis, we propose here to consider hyperrectangles, where some edges connect sequences being two or more mutations away from each other. The present work formalizes the theoretical knowledge about these novel structures and compares the amount of epistasis identified in hypercubes and hyperrectangles constructed from experimental datasets. A new algorithm, CuboidME, was developed for calculating hyperrectangles, which were then compared to hypercubes. In the experimental datasets, there were four orders of magnitude more hyperrectangles than hypercubes for the same sample size. Subsequently, we showed that for the studied datasets there is an increase in epistasis measured by epistatic coefficients in hyperrectangles compared to hypercubes. For the same datasets, hyperrectangles could find more sign epistasis than using hypercubes alone. We also show that there is a trend for increase in epistasis with increasing number of mutations being considered in a hyperrectangle. The results indicate that hyperrectangles can be used to reveal more information on epistasis in a fitness landscape, especially if it is combinatorially incomplete.',

To detect epistasis, fitness must be measured for at least four genotypes: the reference genotype, two different single mutants and a double mutant with both of the single mutations. For higher-order epistasis of the order n, fitness has to be measured for all 2n genotypes of an n-dimensional hypercube in genotype space forming a ‚Äòcombinatorially complete dataset‚Äô. So far, only a handful of such datasets have been produced by manual curation. Concurrently, random mutagenesis experiments have produced measurements of fitness and other phenotypes in a high-throughput manner, potentially containing a number of combinatorially complete datasets.\rResults\rWe present an effective recursive algorithm for finding all hypercube structures in random mutagenesis experimental data. To test the algorithm, we applied it to the data from a recent HIS3 protein dataset and found all 199 847 053 unique combinatorially complete genotype combinations of dimensionality ranging from 2 to 12. The algorithm may be useful for researchers looking for higher-order epistasis in their high-throughput experimental data.',

Just 15% of amino acids found in yeast His3 orthologues were always neutral while the impact on fitness of the remaining 85% depended on the genetic background. Furthermore, at 67% of sites, amino acid replacements were under sign epistasis, having both strongly positive and negative effect in different genetic backgrounds. 46% of sites were under reciprocal sign epistasis. The fitness impact of amino acid replacements was influenced by only a few genetic backgrounds but involved interaction of multiple sites, shaping a rugged fitness landscape in which many of the shortest paths between highly fit genotypes are inaccessible.',
