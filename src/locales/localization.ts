            description:
              'The molecular toxicity of uranyl ion (UO22+) in living cells is mainly conditioned by its high affinity to both native and potential metal-binding sites frequently occurring in biomolecules structure. Recent advances in computational and experimental research shed light on the structural properties and functional impacts of uranyl binding to proteins, organic ligands, nucleic acids and their complexes. In the present work, we report the results of the theoretical investigation of the uranyl-mediated loss of DNA-binding activity of PARP-1, eukaryotic enzyme that participates in DNA reparation, cell differentiation, induction of inflammation, etc. Latest experimental studies showed that uranyl ion directly interacts with its DNA-binding subdomains - zinc fingers Zn1 and Zn2, - and changes their tertiary structure. Here, we propose an atomistic mechanism underlying this process and compute the free energy change along the suggested pathway to prove its relevance. According to the results of our QM/MM simulations of Zn2-UO22+ complex, uranyl ion replaces zinc in its native binding site, but the corresponding state is destroyed because of the following spontaneous internal hydrolysis of the U-Cys162 coordination bond. Although the enthalpy of hydrolysis is +2.8 kcal/mol, the final value of the free energy of the reaction constitutes -0.6 kcal/mol, due to structure loosening evidenced by solvation and configuration thermodynamic properties calculated using GIST- and MIST-based trajectory processing techniques. The subsequent reorganization of the binding site includes association of uranyl ion with the Glu190/Asp191 acidic cluster and significant perturbations in the domain\'s tertiary structure, which further decreases the free energy of the non-functional state by 6.8 kcal/mol. The disruption of the DNA-binding interface revealed in our computational simulations is consistent with previous experimental findings and appears to be associated with the loss of the Zn2 affinity for nucleic acids.',

The active site, however, is sensitive to mutations due to a high density of molecular interactions, substantially reducing the likelihood of obtaining functional multipoint mutants. We introduce an atomistic and machine-learning-based approach, called high-throughput Functional Libraries (htFuncLib), that designs a sequence space in which mutations form low-energy combinations that mitigate the risk of incompatible interactions. We apply htFuncLib to the GFP chromophore-binding pocket, and, using fluorescence readout, recover >16,000 unique designs encoding as many as eight active-site mutations. Many designs exhibit substantial and useful diversity in functional thermostability (up to 96 ¬∞C), fluorescence lifetime, and quantum yield. By eliminating incompatible active-site mutations, htFuncLib generates a large diversity of functional sequences. We envision that htFuncLib will be used in one-shot optimization of activity in enzymes, binders, and other proteins.',

              'Mutations that prevent the production of proteins in the DMD gene cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Most frequently, these are deletions leading to reading-frame shift. The ‚Äúreading-frame rule‚Äù states that deletions that preserve ORF result in a milder Becker muscular dystrophy. By removing several exons, new genome editing tools enable reading-frame restoration in DMD with the production of BMD-like dystrophins. However, not every truncated dystrophin with a significant internal loss functions properly. To determine the effectiveness of potential genome editing, each variant should be carefully studied in vitro or in vivo. In this study, we focused on the deletion of exons 8‚Äì50 as a potential reading-frame restoration option. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 tool, we created the novel mouse model DMDdel8-50, which has an in-frame deletion in the DMD gene. We compared DMDdel8-50 mice to C57Bl6/CBA background control mice and previously generated DMDdel8-34 KO mice. We discovered that the shortened protein was expressed and correctly localized on the sarcolemma. The truncated protein, on the other hand, was unable to function like a full-length dystrophin and prevent disease progression. On the basis of protein expression, histological examination, and physical assessment of the mice, we concluded that the deletion of exons 8‚Äì50 is an exception to the reading-frame rule.',

Presently, it is unknown if the AlphaFold-triggered revolution could help to solve other problems related to protein folding. Here we assay the ability of AlphaFold to predict the impact of single mutations on protein stability (ŒîŒîG) and function. To study the question we extracted metrics from AlphaFold predictions before and after single mutation in a protein and correlated the predicted change with the experimentally known ŒîŒîG values. Additionally, we correlated the AlphaFold predictions on the impact of a single mutation on structure with a large scale dataset of single mutations in GFP with the experimentally assayed levels of fluorescence. We found a very weak or no correlation between AlphaFold output metrics and change of protein stability or fluorescence. Our results imply that AlphaFold cannot be immediately applied to other problems or applications in protein folding.',

              'Prediction of proteins stability change (ŒîŒîG) due to single mutation is important for biotechnology, medicine, and our understanding of physics underlying protein folding. Despite the recent tremendous success in 3D protein structure prediction, the apparently simpler problem of predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability has been hampered by the low amount of experimental data. With the recent high-throughput measurements of mutational effects in ‚Äòmega‚Äô experiment for ~850,000 mutations [Tsuboyama et al., bioRxiv, 2022] it becomes possible to apply the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Here we explore the ability of ESM2 deep neural network architecture with added Light Attention mechanism to predict the change of protein stability due to single mutations. The resulting method ABYSSAL predicts well the data from the ‚Äòmega‚Äô experiment (Pearson correlation 0.85) while the prediction of ŒîŒîG values from previous experiments is more modest (Pearson correlation 0.50). ABYSSAL also shows a perfect satisfaction of the antisymmetry property. The ABYSSAL training demonstrated that the dataset should contain around ~100,000 data points for taking advantage of the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Overall, our study shows great perspectives for developing the deep learning ŒîŒîG predictors..',

              'The ability of protein chains to spontaneously form their three-dimensional structures is a long-standing mystery in molecular biology. The most conceptual aspect of this mystery is how the protein chain can find its native, ‚Äúworking‚Äù spatial structure (which, for not too big protein chains, corresponds to the global free energy minimum) in a biologically reasonable time, without exhaustive enumeration of all possible conformations, which would take billions of years. This is the so-called ‚ÄúLevinthal‚Äôs paradox.‚Äù In this review, we discuss the key ideas and discoveries leading to the current understanding of protein folding kinetics, including folding landscapes and funnels, free energy barriers at the folding/unfolding pathways, and the solution of Levinthal‚Äôs paradox. A special role here is played by the ‚Äúall-or-none‚Äù phase transition occurring at protein folding and unfolding and by the point of thermodynamic (and kinetic) equilibrium between the ‚Äúnative‚Äù and the ‚Äúunfolded‚Äù phases of the protein chain (where the theory obtains the simplest form). The modern theory provides an understanding of key features of protein folding and, in good agreement with experiments, it (i) outlines the chain length-dependent range of protein folding times, (ii) predicts the observed maximal size of ‚Äúfoldable‚Äù proteins and domains. Besides, it predicts the maximal size of proteins and domains that fold under solely thermodynamic (rather than kinetic) control. Complementarily, a theoretical analysis of the number of possible protein folding patterns, performed at the level of formation and assembly of secondary structures, correctly outlines the upper limit of protein folding times.',

              'Prediction of protein stability change upon mutation (ŒîŒîG) is crucial for facilitating protein engineering and understanding of protein folding principles. Robust prediction of protein folding free energy change requires the knowledge of protein three-dimensional (3D) structure. In case, protein 3D structure is not available, one can predict the structure from protein sequence; however, the perspectives of ŒîŒîG predictions for predicted protein structures are unknown. The accuracy of using 3D structures of the best templates for the ŒîŒîG prediction is also unclear.\rTo investigate these questions, we used a representative set of seven diverse and accurate publicly available tools (FoldX, Eris, Rosetta, DDGun, ACDC-NN, ThermoNet and DynaMut) for stability change prediction combined with AlphaFold or I-Tasser for protein 3D structure prediction. We found that best templates perform consistently better than (or similar to) homology models for all ŒîŒîG predictors.

            description:
              'The intricate genotype-phenotype relationship has been a long-standing issue in biology, important both from the fundamental and applied points of view. One of the major irregularities hindering progress in establishing these links is epistasis ‚Äì the complex and elusive interaction between mutations. Despite the vast accumulated genetic data and progress in this area, epistasis is still far from being completely understood. Epistasis can be studied quantitatively in combinatorially complete datasets, which form hypercubes in protein sequence space, where connected sequences are one mutation away from each other. However, this might be insufficient to portray the full picture of epistatic interactions. To extend the repertoire of the methods for exploring epistasis, we propose here to consider hyperrectangles, where some edges connect sequences being two or more mutations away from each other. The present work formalizes the theoretical knowledge about these novel structures and compares the amount of epistasis identified in hypercubes and hyperrectangles constructed from experimental datasets. A new algorithm, CuboidME, was developed for calculating hyperrectangles, which were then compared to hypercubes. In the experimental datasets, there were four orders of magnitude more hyperrectangles than hypercubes for the same sample size. Subsequently, we showed that for the studied datasets there is an increase in epistasis measured by epistatic coefficients in hyperrectangles compared to hypercubes. For the same datasets, hyperrectangles could find more sign epistasis than using hypercubes alone. We also show that there is a trend for increase in epistasis with increasing number of mutations being considered in a hyperrectangle. The results indicate that hyperrectangles can be used to reveal more information on epistasis in a fitness landscape, especially if it is combinatorially incomplete.',

So far, only a handful of such datasets have been produced by manual curation. Concurrently, random mutagenesis experiments have produced measurements of fitness and other phenotypes in a high-throughput manner, potentially containing a number of combinatorially complete datasets.\rResults\rWe present an effective recursive algorithm for finding all hypercube structures in random mutagenesis experimental data.

Furthermore, at 67% of sites, amino acid replacements were under sign epistasis, having both strongly positive and negative effect in different genetic backgrounds. 46% of sites were under reciprocal sign epistasis.
